Edit the provided food photo for a clean, professional menu presentation.

SCENE:
- Surface: weathered reclaimed wood tabletop (gray-brown driftwood tones), natural grain.
- Lighting: warm golden light from upper-left, soft natural fill.
- Depth of field: shallow DOF; dish is sharp; background softly blurred.

NO PROPS - just the dish on the tabletop.

RETOUCHING:
- Remove kitchen/prep-table context and distractions.
- Clean plate rim smears and messy drips; keep food texture realistic.
- Reduce harsh glare while keeping sauces glossy.
- Correct color casts; maintain warm, appetizing tones.
- Add subtle contact shadow under the plate.

HARD CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not change the dish identity, ingredients, or portion.
- Do not add text, logos, watermarks, steam effects, or painterly looks.
- Do not switch to black/slate or sterile white backgrounds.
- Fried items should look golden and crispy.
