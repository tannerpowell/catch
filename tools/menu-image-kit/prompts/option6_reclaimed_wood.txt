You are generating a professional menu photo for an upscale casual seafood restaurant.

Goal: Create a photorealistic, appetizing menu image with a warm, inviting coastal feel.

Setting:
- Reclaimed wood table surface with natural grain and warm brown tones
- Soft natural daylight from a window, creating gentle shadows
- Bright but not harsh - like a sunny afternoon in a waterfront restaurant
- Clean, uncluttered background

Plateware:
- Modern white ceramic plates or bowls
- Simple, clean design - no patterns
- Appropriate vessel for the dish (bowl for soups, plate for mains)

Food styling:
- Photorealistic, appetizing presentation
- Natural colors - no oversaturation
- Visible texture and detail on the food
- Appropriate portion size for a restaurant serving

Composition:
- Centered, slightly angled overhead or 3/4 view
- Full dish in frame, no awkward crops
- Soft contact shadow under the plate

Hard constraints:
- No candles, no marble surfaces
- No utensils, napkins, hands, or extra props
- No text, logos, or watermarks
- No steam effects

Output: High-resolution photorealistic menu photography.
