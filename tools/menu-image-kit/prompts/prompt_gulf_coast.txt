Edit the provided food photo into a warm, inviting Gulf Coast seafood restaurant menu image.

Primary goal: consistency across the full set. Keep the dish faithful to the original—do not invent ingredients.

SCENE / SET:
- Surface: light whitewashed wood planks (beach house aesthetic), subtle weathering and grain.
- Lighting: bright natural daylight from upper-left, cheerful and airy; slight warm cast.
- Depth of field: shallow DOF; dish is sharp; background is softly blurred.
- Color grade: bright, fresh, coastal—blues and teals in background hints are acceptable.

PROPS (minimal, consistent style):
- One blue-striped linen napkin, casually folded.
- Small white ceramic sauce bowl.
- Lemon wedge near seafood dishes only.
- Props must not cover the food.

RETOUCHING:
- Remove kitchen/prep-table context.
- Clean plate rim smears; keep food texture realistic.
- Reduce glare while keeping sauces appetizing.
- Correct color casts; maintain bright coastal warmth.
- Add subtle contact shadow under the plate.

HARD CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not change the dish identity, ingredients, or portion.
- Do not add text, logos, watermarks, steam effects, or painterly looks.
- Do not use dark/moody backgrounds.
- Fried items should look golden and crispy.
