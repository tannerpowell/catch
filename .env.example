# Kitchen Order Management
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: KITCHEN_JWT_SECRET and SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN must be different and kept secret
# They serve different purposes: JWT signing vs. Sanity CMS API access
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32

# API Token - Simple shared secret for backwards compatibility (DEPRECATED)
# ⚠️ This simple format is insecure and will be removed in future versions
# Use JWT tokens instead (see KITCHEN_JWT_SECRET below)
# KITCHEN_API_TOKEN=your-secure-random-token-here

# JWT Secret - Used to sign and verify JWT tokens for kitchen staff authentication
# This is the REQUIRED method for production deployments
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32

# SECURITY: Authentication Configuration
# ============================================================================
# ⚠️ INTERNAL NOTE: There is a development-only auth bypass flag documented in
# docs/INTERNAL-SECURITY-DEV.md that should NEVER be used in production or
# shared publicly. It is protected by runtime safeguards.
# ============================================================================

# Authentication Provider Configuration
# Uncomment and configure based on your chosen auth provider:

## NextAuth.js
# NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret  # Generate: openssl rand -base64 32

## Clerk
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
# CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

## Custom JWT
# JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret  # Generate: openssl rand -base64 32
# JWT_ISSUER=your-app-name
